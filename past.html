Bhabha with support from the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, was India’s first dedicated research unit in high-energy physics, initially based at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore before moving to Bombay, where it became the nucleus of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research; its pioneering studies of cosmic rays not only advanced particle physics in India but also laid the foundation for TIFR’s later expansion into nuclear, astrophysics, and space sciences, symbolizing the country’s early commitment to building world-class scientific institutions.",

            "ISRO’s Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3), developed in the late 1970s, was India’s first experimental satellite launch vehicle and marked the country’s entry into spacefaring nations. It was an all-solid, four-stage rocket, 22 meters tall and weighing 17 tonnes, capable of placing a 40 kg payload into low Earth orbit. The first flight in August 1979 was only partially successful, but on July 18, 1980, SLV-3 successfully launched the Rohini Satellite (RS-1) from Sriharikota, making India the sixth nation to achieve satellite launch capability. Two more launches followed in 1981 and 1983, orbiting Rohini satellites with remote sensing instruments, and though the program was retired after four flights, SLV-3 laid the technological foundation for India’s later launch vehicles like the ASLV and PSLV.",
